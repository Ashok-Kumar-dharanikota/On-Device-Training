# On-Device Training with TensorFlow Lite (Old Approach)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of on-device training using TensorFlow Lite, specifically the old approach. The goal of on-device training is to enable training machine learning models directly on mobile devices, eliminating the need for constant network communication with a server.

This readme file provides an overview of the project, details on how on-device training is implemented using the old approach, and instructions for setting up the project. Additionally, it covers the save and restore functionalities to preserve and resume training progress.

## Features

1. **On-Device Training**: The app allows training machine learning models directly on mobile devices, leveraging TensorFlow Lite's capabilities. This feature eliminates the need for sending data to a remote server for training.

2. **Save and Restore Functionalities**: The app provides functionalities to save and restore training progress. Users can pause training and resume from the saved state at a later time.

## Implementation Details

The on-device training using the old approach is implemented as follows:

1. The app includes a pre-trained machine learning model stored in the TensorFlow Lite format.

2. During training, the app collects training data from the user, preprocesses it, and feeds it into the pre-trained model.

3. The app uses techniques such as transfer learning or fine-tuning to update the weights of the pre-trained model using the collected data.

4. The updated model is then saved and can be used for inference on the device.

5. To enable save and restore functionalities, the app saves the current model state periodically during training. The model state includes the weights, optimizer state, and other necessary parameters.

6. When training is resumed, the app restores the saved model state and continues training from where it left off.

## Requirements

To set up and run this project, you need the following:

- Android Studio (version X.X.X or higher): The integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
- An Android device or emulator: To run the app and test its functionality.
- TensorFlow Lite: The TensorFlow Lite library is required for on-device training and inference.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone[ https://github.com/Ashok-Kumar-dharanikota/on-device-training.git](https://github.com/Ashok-Kumar-dharanikota/On-Device-Training.git)


2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."

3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and select the project.

4. Connect your Android device to your machine or set up an emulator.

5. Ensure that your device/emulator has developer options and USB debugging enabled.

6. Build and run the project on your device/emulator.

7. Install the required dependencies for TensorFlow Lite using the following command:


8. Configure the project to use the pre-trained model for on-device training. Update the code to include the desired training logic and save and restore functionalities.

9. Build and run the project again to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can use the app as follows:

1. Launch the app on your device/emulator.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the on-device training process.

3. The app will collect training data from the user and update the pre-trained model accordingly.

4. To pause training and save the model state, use the provided save functionality.

5. To resume training from the saved state, use the restore functionality.
